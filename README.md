# matplotlib-challenge
# Pymaceuticals
Objective: To get a better understanding of using jupyter notebook, and how to plot using matplotlib and panadas. 
We are looking at data from a pharmaceutical company that works with anti-cancer medication. We will looking at how the different types of anti-cancer medication will affect mice, and the tumour volume on the mice. 

# Instructions
Please open the file called: main.ipynb in the matplotlib-challenge/Pymaceuticals and run the code.

Here, we would see information on some summary statistics of different drug regimens and the tumor volume, bar charts on the different drug regimens versus the mouse timepoints, pie charts on the distrubtion of male versus female mice, identifying any outliers in the drug regimen of 4 drugs and plotting a box plot, a line graph of how the tumor volume changed on Mouse l509 with the treatment of the Campomulin drug, a scatter plot of the average tumor volume and mouse weight with the Campomulin drug as well as calculating the correlation coefficient and a linear regression model. 

The data was originally merged from 2 CSV files located in the data folder.
